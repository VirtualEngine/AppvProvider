	App-V Provider

SYNOPSIS
	The App-V provider is a OneGet/Windows Package Management provider for Microsoft
    Application Virtualization (App-V) v5.x.

DESCRIPTION
    The App-V provider can install and uninstall Microsoft App-V v5.x packages
    from local and/or remote directory paths with a behaviour that is is consistent
    with all other Microsoft OneGet/Package Management providers.
    
    The App-V provider project is an open-source implementation of a Micrsoft
    Application Virtualization (App-V) 5.x provider for OneGet/Microsoft Package
    Management Powershell module(s). More information on the open-source OneGet
    project can be found online: https://github.com/oneget/oneget.
    
REGISTERING PACKAGE SOURCE(S)
    The App-V provider will search local directories and/or network file shares
    for available packages. Each individual directory or file share needs to be
    registered in the provider before it can be used.
    
    Provider locations are added with the Register-PackageSource cmdlet and
    require a name to also be provided. To register a network file share with a
    reference name of 'Demo' use the following command:
    
    Register-PackageSource -Name Demo -Location \\Server\Share -ProviderName AppV 
    
    The location parameter has to be a Powershell File System provider path.
    HTTP/S streaming end-points/locations are NOT currently supported.

DISCOVERING APP-V APPLICATIONS
    Once an App-V provider package source has been registered, it can be queried
    for available packages by using the Find-Package cmdlet. By default, the
    App-V provider implements wildcard pattern matching for application names.
    Searching for Chrome will return packages matching 'GoogleChrome', 'xChrome'
    and 'ChromeDriver2'.

    To query all registered package sources for packages containing the search
    term 'Chrome', run the following command:

    Find-Package -Name Chrome

    To query all registered package sources for packages containing either the
    'Chrome' or 'Firefox' search terms, run the following command:

    Find-Package -Name Chrome,Firefox

    However, this will return all matching packages. To restrict the search
    scope to just App-V packages, the Find-Package cmdlet can be filter by the
    provider name. To query for all available App-V packages use the following
    command:

    Find-Package -ProviderName AppV
    
    To restrict the query to only App-V packages with either 'Chrome' or
    'Firefox' in the name, filter the scope with the following command:

    Find-Package -Name Chrome,Firefox -ProviderName AppV
    
INSTALLING APP-V APPLICATIONS
    Installing applications is achieved by the OneGet Install-Package cmdlet. One
    or more packages can be specified with the -Name parameter or piped into
    Install-Package from the Find-Package cmdlet.

    Find-Package -Name Chrome -ProviderName AppV | Install-Package

    The Install-Package cmdlet supports the same filtering options as the
    Find-Package cmdlet. For example, you can filter on the name and/or the
    provider name.

    The App-V provider also implements some App-V specific package installation
    parameters, implementing the -Global and -Mount switches.

    The -Mount switch parameter will mount the package in the App-V client
    cache after the package is registered. Without this option, the application
    will be streamed over the network upon first use.

    Install-Package -Name Chrome -ProviderName AppV -Mount

    By default, the App-V provider will only publish applications to the user
    running the Install-Package cmdlet - this is typically an administrator
    account. To publish the application globally (to all users), include the
    -Global switch parameter.

    Install-Package -Name Chrome,Firefox -ProviderName AppV -Global

    You can combine the -Mount and -Global switches in the same command.

    Install-Package -Name Firefox -ProviderName AppV -Global -Mount

UNINSTALLING APP-V APPLICATIONS
    

DEREGISTERING PACKAGE SOURCE(S)
    Removing registered package sources requires running the 
    Unregister-PackageSource cmdlet. This cmdlet requires the package source name
    and the provider name that is was registered with.
    
    To remove the 'Demo' App-V provider package source registered above, use the
    following command:
    
    Unregister-PackageSource -Name Demo -ProviderName AppV
    
    The OneGet implementation supports the removal of package sources using
    the -Location parameter. This is NOT currently supported by the App-V provider.
